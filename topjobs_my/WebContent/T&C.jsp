				<p>
					In some areas of our site, we request or may request that you
					provide personal information, including your name, address, e-mail
					address, telephone number, credit card number, National Identity
					Card number, Passport details, contact information, and any other
					information from which your identity is discernible.<br> In
					other areas, this site collects or may collect demographic
					information that is not unique to you such as your age,
					preferences, gender, and interests.<br>We also gather or may
					gather certain information about your use of our site, such as what
					areas you visit and what services you access.<br> Moreover,
					there is information about your computer hardware and software that
					is or may be collected by this site.<br> This information can
					include without limitation your IP address, browser type, domain
					names, access times and referring Web site addresses.<br>This
					site may sometimes afford you the opportunity to provide
					descriptive, cultural, behavioral, preferential and/or life style
					information about yourself, but it is solely up to you whether you
					furnish such information. <br>If you do provide such
					information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that
					information in accordance with the policies and practices described
					in this Statement.<br> For example, such information may be
					used for the purpose of determining your potential interest in
					receiving email or other communications about particular products
					or services.<br>Since we believe that managing your career is
					a life-long process, we retain indefinitely all the information we
					gather about you in an effort to make your repeat use with us more
					efficient, practical, and relevant.<br> Of course, you can
					correct or update your account profile and resume at any time.<br>
					Moreover, you can request that we delete your details from our
					online database or close your SITE account at any time, in which
					event we will remove all our copies of your resume and account
					profile information except for an archival copy which is not
					accessible on the Internet.

					personal, demographic, collective or technical, for the purpose of
					operating and improving the Web site, fostering a positive user
					experience, and delivering the products and services that we offer.<br>
					We may use your contact information in order to send you e-mail or
					other communications regarding updates at the site, such as new
					opportunities and additional listings which may be of interest to
					you.<br> The nature and frequency of these messages will vary
					depending upon the information we have about you.<br> We have
					an area where you can submit feedback.<br> Any feedback you
					submit in this area becomes our property, and we can use such

			<button class="collapsible">Disclosure of Information to Others</button>
			<div class="content">
				<p>
					We do not disclose to third parties your personal information,
					combined personal and demographic information or information about
					your use of this Web site (such as the areas you visit or the
					services you access), except as set forth in the following four
					subparagraphs.<br> We may disclose such information to third
					parties if you consent to such disclosure. For example, if you
					apply for a vacancy posted by an employer registered to this site,
					we may supply your information to these employers, or recruiters
					for the purpose of sending you e-mail or otherwise communicating
					with you. <br>We may use data we have about you to determine
					whether you might be interested in the career opportunities posted
					by a registered employer.<br> We may disclose such information
					to companies and individuals we employ to perform functions on our
					behalf. Examples may include hosting our Web servers, analyzing
					data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card
					payments, and providing customer service.<br> These companies
					and individuals will have access to your personal information as
					necessary to perform their functions, but they may not share that
					information with any other third party.<br> We may disclose
					such information if legally required to do so, if requested to do
					so by a governmental entity or if we believe in good faith that
					such action is necessary to: (a) conform to legal requirements or
					comply with legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of
					this site or its affiliated companies; (c) prevent a crime or
					protect national security; or (d) protect the personal safety of
					users or the public. We may disclose and transfer such information
					to a third party who acquires all or a substantial portion of this

				<p>
					This site uses "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your
					online experience and time online.<br> A cookie is a text file
					that is placed on your hard drive by a Web page server.<br>
					Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver viruses to your
					computer.<br> Cookies are uniquely assigned to your computer,
					and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that issued the
					cookie to you.<br> One of the primary purposes of cookies is
					to provide a convenience feature to save you time.<br> The
					purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have
					returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize pages,
					or register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific
					information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because
					of our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate
					results and a more personalized site experience.<br> When you
					return to the site, the information you previously provided can be
					retrieved, so you can easily use the features that you customized.
					<br>We also use cookies to track click streams and for load
					balancing.<br> You may have the ability to accept or decline
					cookies.<br> Most Web browsers automatically accept cookies,
					but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline all
					cookies if you prefer.<br> Alternatively, you may be able to
					modify your browser setting to notify you each time a cookie is
					tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an
					individual basis.<br> If you choose to decline cookies,
					however, that may hinder performance and negatively impact your
					experience on this Web site.

					newsletters, commercial e-mails or other communications from this
					site or third parties at the time you registered with this site,
					but subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing your
					Account Profile as described above. If you previously opted not to
